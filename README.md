# flask_intro
Basic Task Master app using Python and Flask

This was one of my earlier projects that I followed using a Flask tutorial to gain an understanding of basic CRUD fundamentals and Python web development.
I completed this project a few weeks before starting my Fullstack Academy program. Having Python knowledge at the time, I was interested in experimenting with other
frameworks that Python had to offer.
